That opens up all kinds of intriguing possibilities. Could you fly some AXE Apollo Deodorant up to the ISS (this would cost $2,220 based on the product’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.target.com/p/axe-apollo-all-day-fresh-deodorant-stick-3oz/-/A-14413795?ref=tgt_adv_XS000000&amp;AFID=google_pla_df&amp;fndsrc=tmnv&amp;DFA=71700000089637547&amp;CPNG=PLA_DVM%2B1%3Ea064R000012IxqaQAC-Unilever_Deo_Google+Search_Jan_2022_Axe&amp;adgroup=PLA_Unilever_Deo&amp;LID=700000001393753pgs&amp;network=g&amp;device=c&amp;location=9061262&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwyYKUBhDJARIsAMj9lkGnK39fmbtllHAfR5qouVTyWN7zdk0tUu652vkJgtJf9RLIUW7zmoQaAhsJEALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" style="font-size: 13px;">113 gram weight</a>), and then pay an astronaut $130,000 to talk about it for an hour, or perhaps to apply a bit under their spacesuit?</p><p>Probably not. Although NASA’s policies are dense and a bit hard to decipher, it appears that private companies can’t pay NASA astronauts to appear on camera. Doing so could “imply that the Commercial Activity is endorsed or supported by NASA,” which is forbidden. Companies also can’t use the intellectual property of NASA or its crew members, which probably includes their likenesses and the symbols and logos on their uniforms.</p><p>But there’s a workaround. NASA’s price list includes an entire large section about “Private Astronaut” activities. Basically, NASA is saying that if you can fly your own marketing department up to the ISS (book a ticket&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/05/31/spacex-nasa-docking-international-space-station/?itid=lk_inline_manual_48" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">with SpaceX</a>), they’ll provide such things as food ($2,000 per day), crew provisions like “office supplies” and “sleeping bags” (up to $1,500 per day), and stowage ($700 per cubic foot).</p><p>Heads up: you’ll also need to fork over $10 million per mission for basic services including communications with the ground and training once aboard the station. The good news? Both “life support” and “12 gigabytes of data per person, per day for videos, pictures and emails” are included.</p><p>A smart marketing director with a massive budget could do a lot with these capabilities. A company could send a spokesperson to the ISS, have them use the company’s product while aboard, and film a literally out-of-this-world commercial. Given that a Superbowl ad already costs&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wcvb.com/article/super-bowl-commercials-cost-7-million-it-s-still-a-good-deal/39044081#:~:text=The%20latest%20entertainment%20headlines%2C%20delivered,commercials%20cost%20%247%20million%20each." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">around $7 million</a>, the $15 million or so that you’d pay to shoot a space commercial isn’t too bad.</p><p>NASA’s private astronaut policies could allow for some fantastic PR stunts, too. A tech company could fly its CEO to the ISS and have them take Zoom calls from space to advertise the flexibility of the company’s remote work policies, attracting new hires.</p>
