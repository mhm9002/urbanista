<h1>About</h1><p class="ql-align-justify">MyBrowserAddon is a community for open-source projects. It houses the documentation, tutorial, frequently asked questions and also form to report bugs for open-source projects. This website is dedicated to developers who are interested in learning about open-source and also contributing to these projects. Here, you can explore different ways we serve the open-source community and also help us make these open-source projects even more awesome! Open-source development promotes not only innovation but also accelerates progress in all aspects of software development. Currently, we are focused on supporting free browser-based projects (add-on, plug-in, etc.) within communities. In the future, we will branch out to other areas including health and education.</p><p class="ql-align-justify">All open-source projects presented here, come from collaborative development from independent developers around the world. We hope to eventually generate a diverse scope of products that are available freely to everyone. A report in 2008 by&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standish_Group" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(47, 164, 231);">Standish Group</a>&nbsp;states that the adoption of open-source software models has resulted in savings of about $60 billion per year to consumers around the world. An open-source project (referred to as software here) is software which, its source code is available to the public for modification or enhancement. It can be improved by adding features to it or fixing parts that do not always work correctly. Our supported add-ons are usually stored in a publicly accessible repository which is just a collection of folders/files hosted on a public git (i.e. BitBucket, GitHub). Anyone can fork to these repositories and contribute to the development of these products.</p><p class="ql-align-justify">In order to download and use an add-on, please visit the official store for each browser (<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(47, 164, 231);">Mozilla Firefox</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(47, 164, 231);">Chrome</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://addons.opera.com/en/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(47, 164, 231);">Opera</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://safari-extensions.apple.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(47, 164, 231);">Safari</a>), and use the provided download links in order to add the extension/app to your browser.
