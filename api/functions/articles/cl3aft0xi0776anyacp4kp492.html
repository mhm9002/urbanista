<p>The increase in the near-surface temperature inside the city is one of the side effects of urbanization. This increase generally causes outdoor human discomfort and is known as the urban heat island effect. The effects of urban heat island (UHI) go beyond human thermal comfort in the outdoor environment to participate in heat-related morbidities and mortalities. A study of the influence of street canyons on pedestrian comfort in Philadelphia (Oka, 2011) has suggest-ed that the urban heat island (UHI) effect is a significant component that amplifies the effects of heat stress on inhabitants. Another study (Mahmoud, 2019) has investigated the relationship between newly built housing development in Aswan - Egypt, and the urban heat island effect. Based on the building orientation and configuration, the study has identified a difference of 20 °C in Physiological Equivalent Temperature (PET) within the studied development. Such increase has evident impacts on human health and heat-related morbidities.</p><p>The study of the urban heat island (UHI) effect branches from the urban climate field - a relatively new science - en-gages a wide range of disciplines with many interests in the field (Oke, 2006). Most studies, therefore, were conducted within a brief time and used ranges of parameters overarch-ing these disciplines. It is vital for studies engaged with the climate and the built environment to clearly define parameters under study, scope, scale, and time interval. Researchers from different disciplines, including climatology, engineer-ing, urban planning, architecture, and social science, all refer to the field of urban climate as "Home" (Oke, 2006). Approaches to the field, however, vary according to the scale and the time frame. For instance, the study of air circulation within a park has a local scale ranging from hundreds of meters to several kilometers and a timeframe of several hours within the day and the night. Studying the impact of sun-breaker devices, however, involves microscale of the building façade at a precise timing within the day.</p><p>Related to this regard, and while residential zones share the same application, they have a wide range of regulations and land use parameters resulting in significantly different geometries. The residential typology provides a sound basis for microclimate study. They have many common characteristics related to design and operations. At the same time, they vary in geometry and proximities according to the building regulations. This paper aims to investigate the trend of the urban heat island (UHI) effect according to building geometry in the context of Doha's residential zones. Therefore, the study has the following objectives:</p><ol><li>The study will compare UHI effects represented by microclimate heat-related parameters in two residential settlements, which considerably vary in terms of the UHI effect. The two settlements selected for this study are Al-Markhyya and Al-Mansoura. These areas are referred to henceforth as LR and HR, respectively.</li><li>Through simulations, the study will estimate and study dry-bulb temperature and sky view factor parameters of UHI in typical geometry for each settlement based on building regulations and zoning requirements stated by Qatari land use and zoning regulations. Simulating the dry bulb temperature will help in investigating diurnal patterns of UHI in rural and urbanized areas in hot regions.</li><li>The study will conduct site measurements for the actual land surface temperature in both areas at the same time of the night, on multiple nights, and according to the time-line of this study.</li></ol><h1>2. METHODOLOGY</h1><p>A combination of approaches is adopted to collect, prepare, and analyze the data for this study. These approaches include simulation, field measurements, and historical data collection, as summarized in Figure 1. The intent of having multiple approaches is to support results from each by the others and produce a more robust trend for the relationship under study.</p><p><img src="http://localhost:4000/api/images/5ef358e2a26b14624aebeaf0c023e4f3"></p><p class="ql-align-center">kemwdkmepdomedmepwo</p><p>This study selected two fully functional residential areas in Doha with significantly different building regulations and zoning requirements. The study will focus on parameters directly connected to the geometry of buildings and their proximities, such as height, the number of floors, setbacks, and floor area ratio. Therefore, it is essential to note that regulations related to vegetation, for example, are excluded, although they generally reduce the UHI effect.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>
