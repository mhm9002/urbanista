<p>You have no choice. You will absorb qualities from friends. It will happen at random and you won’t be able to hand-pick the good ones.</p><p>This is but one of many reasons you need great friends in your life.</p><p>Quality social connections help you live longer, better, and happier. Some studies show&nbsp;<a href="https://pathwayshealth.org/hospice-topics/are-best-friends-the-key-to-longevity/#:~:text=Friendships%20are%20just%20as%20important,problems%20and%20indeed%20lived%20longer." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">it’s as</a>&nbsp;important as your diet and lifestyle. Let that sink in.</p><h1>A change of heart</h1><p>Humor was a big part of my household growing up. My mom is really funny. Her side of the family will roast everyone, in a way that might even seem mean to outsiders.</p><p><br></p><p>We are a tough crowd. But it’s all underscored by a sense of love for each other.</p><p>Even though we dish it out, we can take it — because have to. We’ve grown up keeping each other in check. When I meet people who can laugh at their own expense, I see someone who feels like kin.</p><p>The ability to laugh at yourself is criminally underrated. It’s a potent blend of humility and humor. If you meet someone who can laugh at themselves, get their phone number. Invite them to hang out.</p><p>There’s nothing worse than someone who dishes it out and dunks on everyone but gets offended when someone dares make even a small joke their way.</p><p><img src="http://localhost:4000/api/images/80f51985d5e8c2446621d82b54e810b8"></p><p class="ql-align-center"><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(117, 117, 117);">Editorial rights purchased via&nbsp;</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">iStock Photos</span></p><h1>The worst dude</h1><p>I was on the support team for a manager from another department.</p><p><br></p><p>He was the most revolting dude I’d ever worked alongside. He was completely racist and made inappropriate sexual comments — constantly — at the office.</p><p>For example, we were in a clear glass meeting room. A pregnant coworker, Jen, walked by.</p><p>One coworker commented, “Oh I think Jen is due any day now. She is very pregnant.”</p><p>This manager said, in his deep southern drawl, “Yup. If she was with me. She’d stay pregnant.”</p><p>One of his most repugnant qualities was his differential treatment of people. If a superior came walking in, he wore this big fake grin and began cracking jokes, “Hey buddy! Long time no see!”</p><p>The moment the superior left, he turned to everyone else and talked to them like they were Roman Galley Slaves, rowing a ship.</p><p>“Mush! You worthless worms.”</p><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/400/0*SOJOc6L2gw0ty0uX.png" height="300" width="400"></p><p class="ql-align-center">Author via IMGFlip</p><p>Quality friends don’t treat people like baseball cards, coveting certain ones and throwing others in the trash based on their value.</p><h1>Of the self and the selfless</h1><p>Jason Dunham, Ross McGinnis, and Michael Monsoor&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cmohs.org/recipients" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">all have one</a>&nbsp;very special thing in common: Each of them threw their body on a live grenade to save the lives of the soldiers around them.</p><p><br></p><p>These stunning acts of selflessness won them each a Medal of Honor — and laid down proof that humans are not selfish beings.</p><p>In fact, you will not find any other animals that intentionally kill themselves to save their friends’ lives. Despite your cynicism, studies show humans are hardwired&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324009304579041231971683854" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">to be givin</a>g and caring.</p><p>Obviously, many people are wickedly selfish and would betray their own mother to land a raise. You can choose not to have these people in your life.</p><p>Imagine having a friend who would willingly give their own life to save yours. These people exist. Many times, they don’t even know they are that person.</p><p>In the meantime, I suggest you spend your social time with people who don’t see the world through the prism of personal advancement.</p><p>They aren’t fun at dinner parties. And if there’s a sudden zombie apocalypse and you’re running for your life, they’ll be the first to trip you so they can get away.</p><h1>The people who bash</h1><p>When I was young and in high school and college, a few of my friends spent a majority of their time bashing people that weren’t in the room. They did this in a mean-spirited and different way than we had done within my family.</p><p><br></p><p>I sometimes got caught up in it. I came to realize these friends were making me more judgemental. I started to wonder what was being said in my absence.</p><p>Was I even friends with these people?</p><p>Sooner after, I had a broader reckoning that I needed to clean up my life. I was being too welcoming and friendly with unsavory people. I was letting anyone into my life who arrived. It was hurting my character.</p><p>It isn’t like we should treat friendship applications like someone is trying to get into an elite institution. Most of us need more friendships than we currently have.

Choose to associate with people who have something in their character that you admire.</p><p>Otherwise, you’ll just be reminded of why you stopped hanging out with people in the first place.</p><h1>The X-factor person</h1><p>I was at a wedding in my late 20s. I’d been to four in the previous six months.</p><p><br></p><p>I was chatting with a new friend, Matt, saying, “It’s crazy how many weddings there are right now. It’s just one wave after another.”</p><p>Matt shrugged and said, “Well, you know what that means. Next is the wave of divorces.”</p><p>We laughed. But he was right. That is precisely what happened.</p><p>Those jokes aside, Matt had an infectious and authentic smile that won people over from the start. There was an air of lightness about him that I came to appreciate and seek out in others. He made you feel right at home. You could be yourself. Your insecurities vanished.</p><h2>Recap for memory</h2><p>You need friends and strong social connections. Your DNA is begging you for it.</p><p><br></p><p>And yes, if you get close enough with anyone, they may eventually hurt you. That’s the big idea: You find people who are worthy of that risk.</p><p>It’s as Emily Lockhart&nbsp;<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/592399-love-is-when-you-give-someone-else-the-power-to" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a>, </p><blockquote>“Love is when you give someone else the power to destroy you, and you trust them not to do it.”</blockquote><p>Find people with a great sense of humor, who can laugh at themselves, not think about their own self-interest, and make you feel welcome and liked in any setting.</p><p>Life is too short to hang out with people you don’t like.</p>
